# Campus-Navigation-System-
There exist many advanced navigation systems but most of them are unable to provide routes precisely as well as information of building within a region such as campus, shopping mall, hospital and etc. Nowadays, as people are getting more and more connected to technology, they lost their human touch. Also, people feel more convenient to search for the problem themselves rather than asking someone for help.  
An informative, reliable and precise guidance system is very important in this technological era. It should be able to navigate the user no matter the user is under the indoor or outdoor environment. The guidance system must be user-friendly and able to process data efficiently.
Since the size of any college/university campus can vary from 30 acres to anywhere around 200 acres, students spend majority of their time in travelling between different buildings. New students feel inconvenient to search their way inside the campus. Therefore, a navigation system is required to find the optimal path within the campus from one point to another point.
